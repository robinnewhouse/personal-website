                <p>Hello! My name is Robin Newhouse. I am a particle physicist by training and a software engineer by trade.</p>
                <p>For many years I smashed particles together faster than ever before and looked at the weird stuff that comes out. Now I help make the largest cloud infrastructure in the world just a little bit better.</p>
                <p>I am looking for my next adventure at an organization that will benefit from my expertise in distilling powerful insights from big data. My extensive experience in building software, applying AI systems, and communicating complex ideas has prepared me to make impactful contributions to the pressing challenges of our modern world.</p>

            <div class="bio">
                <p>I received a BSc in Astronomy with a minor in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia. Throughout my degree, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at the <a href="https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/">UBC Software Practices Lab</a>, The <a href="http://www.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/?lang=e">Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Institute</a>, and Canada's particle accelerator centre <a href="https://www.triumf.ca/">TRIUMF</a>.</p>

                <p>I graduated in 2022 with a PhD in Physics. My focus was High Energy Particle Physics, in particular, searching for evidence of heavy neutral leptons at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. You can read my dissertation here: <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2845721">Using displaced tracks to search for sterile neutrinos in the ATLAS detector</a>.</p>
 
                <p>It's been a dream of mine to work at CERN and study the fundamentals of our universe since my first science class in 7th grade. It is an honour to work with the brilliant scientists and engineers at CERN as we probe the highest-energy frontier of physics.</p>

            <div class="bio">
                <p>At Amazon Web Services, I am a software engineer on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">RDS</a> open source team. I work on the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://mariadb.org/" target="_blank">MariaDB</a> servers and the automation software that maintains hundreds of thousands of managed database instances in the cloud.</p>
                <p>I'm proud to have helped AWS become the largest external contributor to MariaDB. I also love tackling the challenge of automating internal tools to keep thousands of databases running smoothly with minimal intervention.</p>

            <div class="bio">
                <p>During my time at CERN, I worked on the ATLAS experiment, one of the largest and most complex scientific endeavors in the world. My research focused on searching for evidence of heavy neutral leptons, which are hypothesized particles that could explain the nature of dark matter.</p>
                <p>Working at CERN has been a dream of mine since my first science class in 7th grade. It is an honor to collaborate with brilliant scientists and engineers as we probe the highest-energy frontier of physics.</p>

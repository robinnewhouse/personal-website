                    <p>Hello! My name is Robin Newhouse. I'm a particle physicist by training and a software engineer by trade.</p>
                    <p>I've smashed particles at near light speed to see what pops out, and I've tinkered with the world's biggest cloud to make it run smoother. These days I'm busy teaching machines to use tools, talk to APIs, and actually get stuff done. Agentic AI is my playground.</p>
                    <p>I like problems that don't come with instructions. Big messy datasets, half-baked ideas, strange edge cases. My mix of physics, code, and communication helps me turn the weird into something useful and occasionally even elegant.</p>

                    <p>At CERN, I worked on the <a href="https://atlas.cern/">ATLAS</a> experiment, one of
                        the largest and most complex scientific endeavors in the world. My research hunted for
                        evidence of heavy neutral leptonsâ€”hypothetical particles that could
                        explain the nature of dark matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>Working at CERN was a dream of mine since my first science class in 7th grade. It was an
                        honor to collaborate with brilliant scientists and engineers as we probed the highest-energy
                        frontier of physics.</p>
                    <p>In 2025, I and my colleagues at the ATLAS collaboration were awarded the <a href="https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/1/L3993" target="_blank">Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics</a> for our detailed measurements of the Higgs boson and discoveries at the LHC.</p>

                    <p>At Amazon Web Services, I worked on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/"
                            target="_blank">RDS</a> open source team. I hacked on <a href="https://www.mysql.com/"

                        servers and built automation that keeps hundreds of thousands of managed database
                        instances humming in the cloud.</p>
                    <p>I'm proud to have helped AWS become the largest external contributor to MariaDB. I also loved
                        the challenge of automating internal tools so thousands of databases run
                        smoothly with minimal human intervention.</p>

                        <p>I'm having a lot of fun building AI agents that actually do useful work. Not chatbots that give you recipes, but systems that call APIs, crunch data, and ship results.</p>
                        <p>I've built agents for real estate analytics, document wrangling, and data pipeline taming. The field mutates daily, and I enjoy chasing the latest twist. Every week there's some new trick to make machines more useful (and slightly less inclined to stage a coup).</p>

Since 2014, we've helped over 50,000 people experience the awe of seeing Saturn's rings or touching a meteorite for the first time.</p>
                        <p>There's something magical about watching someone's face light up when they see Jupiter through a telescope. We blend science, art, and storytelling to share the cosmic perspective.</p>

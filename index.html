                    <p>Hello! My name is Robin Newhouse. I am a particle physicist by training and a software engineer
                        by trade.</p>
                    <p>For many years I smashed particles together at record speeds and looked at the weird stuff
                        that comes out. Now I help make the largest cloud infrastructure in the world just a little bit
                        better.</p>
                    <p>I thrive in organizations where I can apply my expertise in extracting insights from big data.
                        My background in software engineering, AI systems, and technical communication enables me to
                        tackle today's most challenging problems.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Education</h2>
                    <p>I received a BSc in Astronomy with a minor in Computer Science from the University of British
                        Columbia. Throughout my degree, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at the <a
                            href="https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/">UBC Software Practices Lab</a>, The <a
                            href="http://www.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/?lang=e">Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck
                            Institute</a>, and Canada's particle accelerator centre <a
                            href="https://www.triumf.ca/">TRIUMF</a>.</p>

                    <p>I graduated in 2022 with a PhD in Physics. My focus was High Energy Particle Physics, in
                        particular, searching for evidence of heavy neutral leptons at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. You
                        can read my dissertation here: <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2845721">Using displaced
                            tracks to search for sterile neutrinos in the ATLAS detector</a>.</p>

                    <p>At Amazon Web Services, I am a software engineer on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/"
                            target="_blank">RDS</a> open source team. I work on the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/"

                        instances in the cloud.</p>
                    <p>I'm proud to have helped AWS become the largest external contributor to MariaDB. I also love
                        tackling the challenge of automating internal tools to keep thousands of databases running
                        smoothly with minimal intervention.</p>

                    <p>During my time at CERN, I worked on the ATLAS experiment, one of the largest and most complex
                        scientific endeavors in the world. My research focused on searching for evidence of heavy
                        neutral leptons, which are hypothesized particles that could explain the nature of dark matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>Working at CERN has been a dream of mine since my first science class in 7th grade. It was an
                        honor to collaborate with brilliant scientists and engineers as we probed the highest-energy
                        frontier of physics.</p>
